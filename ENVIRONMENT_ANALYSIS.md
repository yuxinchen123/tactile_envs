# Tactile Insertion Environment Analysis

## Action Space

The action space is **consistent across all state types**:
- **Type**: `Box(-1.0, 1.0, (3,), float32)`
- **Shape**: `(3,)` - 3D continuous control
- **Bounds**: `[-1, 1]` for each dimension
- **Meaning**: 3D end-effector velocity/displacement commands
  - `action[0]`: X-axis movement
  - `action[1]`: Y-axis movement  
  - `action[2]`: Z-axis movement

## State Types and Their Uses

### 1. **Vision Only** (`state_type='vision'`)
```python
observation = {
    'image': shape(64, 64, 3)  # RGB camera image
}
```
- **Use case**: Vision-only learning (like humans using only eyes)
- **Challenge**: No tactile feedback, must infer contact from vision
- **RL Algorithm**: CNN-based policy networks

### 2. **Touch Only** (`state_type='touch'`)
```python
observation = {
    'tactile': shape(6, 32, 32)  # Tactile sensor data
}
```
- **Use case**: Tactile-only learning (like blind manipulation)
- **Structure**: 6 channels = 3 spatial dimensions × 2 fingers
  - Channels 0-2: Right finger (x, y, z forces/contact)
  - Channels 3-5: Left finger (x, y, z forces/contact)
- **Resolution**: 32×32 per channel (high-resolution tactile sensing)
- **RL Algorithm**: CNN-based policy for tactile data

### 3. **Vision + Touch** (`state_type='vision_and_touch'`)
```python
observation = {
    'image': shape(64, 64, 3),      # RGB camera
    'tactile': shape(6, 32, 32)     # Tactile sensors
}
```
- **Use case**: **Most realistic** - human-like multimodal sensing
- **Challenge**: Need to fuse vision and tactile information
- **RL Algorithm**: Multimodal policy networks (like I implemented)

### 4. **Privileged** (`state_type='privileged'`)
```python
observation = {
    'state': shape(40,)  # Ground truth state
}
```
- **Structure**: `qpos + qvel + [offset_x, offset_y, offset_yaw]`
  - `qpos`: Joint positions (37 values)
  - `qvel`: Joint velocities (37 values)  
  - `[offset_x, offset_y, offset_yaw]`: Target location (3 values)
- **Use case**: 
  - **Cheating/Oracle**: Perfect state information
  - **Baseline**: Upper bound for other methods
  - **Debugging**: Understand what's possible with perfect info

## Should We Use Privileged Info?

### **For Research/Development: YES**
1. **Baseline Performance**: See the upper bound of what's possible
2. **Debugging**: Understand if your RL algorithm is working
3. **Curriculum Learning**: Start with privileged, then move to sensors
4. **Ablation Studies**: Compare privileged vs. sensory approaches

### **For Real-World Applications: NO**
1. **Not Available**: Real robots don't have perfect state knowledge
2. **Sim-to-Real Gap**: Privileged info doesn't transfer to real world
3. **Scientific Goal**: The challenge is learning from sensory data

## Recommended Training Strategy

### Phase 1: Privileged Baseline (Quick validation)
```bash
python train_rl_insertion.py --state_type privileged --total_timesteps 100000
```
- Should achieve high success rate quickly
- Validates that task is learnable

### Phase 2: Tactile Learning (Research focus)
```bash
python train_rl_insertion.py --state_type touch --total_timesteps 1000000
```
- Learn from tactile feedback only
- More challenging but realistic

### Phase 3: Vision Learning (Comparison)
```bash
python train_rl_insertion.py --state_type vision --total_timesteps 1000000
```
- Learn from vision only
- Different challenge than tactile

### Phase 4: Multimodal Learning (Best approach)
```bash
python train_rl_insertion.py --state_type vision_and_touch --total_timesteps 1000000
```
- Combine both modalities
- Most realistic and likely best performance

## Key Insights

1. **Action Space is Simple**: Just 3D continuous control, same for all modes
2. **Privileged State Contains Target**: Perfect knowledge of where to go
3. **Tactile Data is Rich**: 6 channels of high-resolution force/contact info
4. **Vision is Standard**: RGB camera like most vision tasks
5. **Multimodal is Realistic**: Humans use both vision and touch

## Implementation Notes

- **Privileged Policy**: Can use simple heuristic (move toward target)
- **Tactile Policy**: Needs CNN to process 6-channel tactile data
- **Vision Policy**: Standard CNN for RGB images
- **Multimodal Policy**: Fusion network combining both modalities

The environment is well-designed for studying different sensing modalities for manipulation tasks!
